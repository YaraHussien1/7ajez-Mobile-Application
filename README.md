# 7ajez-Mobile-Application
 ## Motivation
   * Although Palestine exists on Google maps, the main problem uncovered is the checkpoints that we face in our every day lives. These checkpoints are not provided on the map and their status is needed for the Palestinian community on a daily basis. The idea of our project will solve a big issue for the Palestinian community as it is needed to know about the best path to be taken for not wasting any time whilst traveling from city to the other. The motivation behind our project is in complete synchronization with the theme that is to organize the checkpointsâ€™ information and make it accessible and useful for the user. Traffic on the roads is also another problem to undertake in our project as it affects the availability of the roads and makes a big issue for the people as to which path is the most available for anyone to take in order to avoid any hazards.

 * Why use Android ?
    - Android is an open source OS anyone can use it and develop it. 
    - Android is a Component based architecture, which means a part can be used in other parts of another operating system. It also provides a mash up, which is combining two or more services to create an application.
    - Android programs got many layers of security.
    - Android takes low power, less memory devices.
   
  
  
 * Why these third parties?
    - Easy to use.
    - More documentation.
    - Free keys.
    - Stable and secure.

  # Conclusion and Discussion
   - The main idea of our APP is to provide the users with the open roads in general.
   - One of the problems was the lack of time, if we had more time we would produce a better work for sure.
   - some technical difficulties came across too:
    * GPS is extremely complex for beginners. it also needs to be more accurate in the West- Bank which affected the functionality of         our app.
    * Hajez application needs to have access to the Internet / WIFI in order for it to function at all.
